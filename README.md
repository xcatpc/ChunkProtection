I forked this Minecraft Server plugin from:
https://github.com/ThePhoenixPixel/ChunkProtection

With this plugin you can simply claim plots in a size of 16x16 (X and Z, Y complete)

Commands:
/cp claim              | Claims a Chunk (16x16 Blocks)
/cp unclaim            | Remove the claim
/cp info               | Get the owner of the chunk
/cp resell <amount>    | Create a sell offer
/cp buy                | Buy a chunk with a sell offer
