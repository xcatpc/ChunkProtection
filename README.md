I forked this Minecraft Server plugin from:
https://github.com/ThePhoenixPixel/ChunkProtection

<h1>ChunkProtection</h1>
<p>The perfect Minecraft Plugin for your server to give Players freedom to build and protect</p>
<h3>With this plugin you can simply claim plots in a size of 16x16 (X and Z, Y complete)</h3>

Commands:<br>
/cp claim              | Claims a Chunk (16x16 Blocks) <br>
/cp unclaim            | Remove the claim<br>
/cp info               | Get the owner of the chunk<br>
/cp resell <amount>    | Create a sell offer<br>
/cp buy                | Buy a chunk with a sell offer<br>
